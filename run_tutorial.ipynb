    "Voila! You'll now see a new `hospital_ae_data.csv` file in the `/data` directory. Open it up and have a browse. It's contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Health Service ID**: NHS number of the admitted patient  \n",
    "- **Age**: age of patient\n",
    "- **Time in A&E (mins)**: time in minutes of how long the patient spent in A&E. This is generated to correlate with the age of the patient.\n",
    "- **Hospital**: which hospital admitted the patient - with some hospitals being more prevalent in the data than others\n",
    "- **Arrival Time**: what time and date the patient was admitted - with weekends as busier and and a different peak time for each day\n",
    "- **Treatment**: what the person was treated for - with certain treatments being more common than others\n",
    "- **Gender**: patient gender - based on [NHS patient gender codes](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_dictionary/attributes/p/person/person_gender_code_de.asp?shownav=1)\n",
    "- **Postcode**: postcode of patient - random, in use, London postcodes extracted from the `London postcodes.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this dataset obviously contains some personal information. For instance, if we knew roughly the time a neighbour went to A&E we could use their postcode to figure out exactly what ailment they went in with. Or, if a list of people's Health Service ID's were to be leaked in future, lots of people could be re-identified.\n",
